## About Project 

I have created a chatbot using deep learning and its algorithms. My aim was that each task tests a unique aspect of text and reasoning, and hence test different capabilities of learning models. More tasks are planned in the future to capture more aspects. Then I plotted my model and seen the accuracy curves. Then I tested it and found that it was working nicely with great accuracy.
